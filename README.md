The purpose of this assignment is to utilize python programming in practical setting to solve real world problems.

What is the purpose of these programs?

A: The purpose of these programs is to create functions that can generate usernames and passwords. These credentials are formed by combining bits of information collected from the user, such as their first name, middle name, last name, and parent's phone number. The aim is to make it challenging for others to recognize or guess the credentials.

Q: What input do these programs take?

A: Both programs take strings as input. For the username generation program, it requires the user's first name, middle name, and last name. For the password generation program, it needs the user's first name, middle name, and parent's phone number.

Q: What is the expected output of these programs?

A: The expected output of both programs is strings. For the username generation program, it produces a username based on the provided information. For the password generation program, it generates a password following the specified rules.

Q: What type of execution is included in these programs?

A: These programs include input, output, repetition (functions), conditionals (if statements), and reuse of code.

Q: How have these programs been improved?

A: The programs have been improved by simplifying the logic in the conditional statements and adding comments to enhance code readability. Additionally, the output is formatted for better presentation.
